##  Relationships

All tables are related using foreign keys to maintain relational integrity:
- Branches are linked to managers.
- Flats are linked to branches.
- Workers are linked to both branches and their managers.

All required `PRIMARY KEY` and `INDEXES` were added using SQL `ALTER TABLE` statements.

##  Example Queries

Here are some example SQL queries used in the project:

- **Select flats cheaper than 150,000:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM flats WHERE Price < 150000;
